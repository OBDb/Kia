## About Kia

Kia Corporation (formerly Kia Motors) is a South Korean multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. The company is South Korea's second-largest automobile manufacturer, after its parent company Hyundai Motor Company.

## Generations

### Early Years (1944-1990s)

Kia was founded in 1944 as Kyungsung Precision Industry, a manufacturer of steel tubing and bicycle parts. The company later expanded to produce complete bicycles, and in 1952, changed its name to Kia Industries. In 1962, Kia began building motorcycles, and by 1974, the company was manufacturing the Brisa, its first passenger car. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Kia focused primarily on small commercial vehicles and entered into licensing agreements with other manufacturers.

### Growth and Global Expansion (1990s-2000s)

In the early 1990s, Kia began expanding globally, establishing sales networks in Europe and the United States. However, the Asian financial crisis of 1997 led to Kia's bankruptcy, after which Hyundai Motor Company acquired a controlling interest in the company. Under Hyundai's leadership, Kia underwent a significant transformation, focusing on improving quality and design. This period saw the introduction of models like the Sportage SUV and Optima sedan that gained international recognition.

### Design Revolution and Modern Era (2006-Present)

In 2006, Kia hired Peter Schreyer, former Audi designer, as Chief Design Officer, marking the beginning of a design revolution for the brand. The introduction of the distinctive "tiger nose" grille became Kia's signature design element. The company expanded its lineup to include a broader range of vehicles, from compact cars to luxury sedans and SUVs. Kia's focus on design, technology, and quality has significantly improved its global market position. In recent years, Kia has invested heavily in electrification and mobility solutions, introducing several electric and hybrid vehicles as part of its shift toward sustainable transportation.
